# TEAM ACTIVITY LOG

## Week 1 (a1)

`Norah Milanesi`: https://github.com/doda2025-team20/app/pull/1\
During this week I collaborated with *Konstantinos* and together we worked on containerizing both frontend and backend, supporting multiple architectures, stages and making them flexible.

`Georgi Dimitrov`:

`Calin-Stefan Georgescu`:

`Konstantinos Syrros`:

`Petre-Alexandru Hautelman`: [lib-version](https://github.com/doda2025-team20/lib-version/pull/1), [app](https://github.com/doda2025-team20/app/pull/4/files)
I worked on the initial implementation of the `lib-version` library. Additionally, I focused on installing and integrating the library into the `app` project. This involved making modifications to the `app` Dockerfile and the GitHub workflow, such that the Maven m2 secrets are not included in the published Docker image.
